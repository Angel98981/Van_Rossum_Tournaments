## Description
As a junior developer on an esports tournament management platform, my goal is to implement an API to:

    * Create, update, delete, and retrieve tournaments, players, and results.
    * Efficiently manage events and keep information up-to-date.

## Key Features

    * Register, retrieve, and update players.
    * Create, update, and delete tournaments.
    * Add participants to tournaments.
    * Retrieve tournaments with their participants.
    * Randomly assign matches between registered players.
    * Record match results with winner, loser, and scores.
    * Retrieve results with score filters, sorting, and pagination.
